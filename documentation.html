            <p>I acknowledge my professor for giving the lectures necessary for the completion of the project, such as
                HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Bootstrap, Node.JS, and React.JS. I also acknowledge Dave Gray, a YouTuber, whom
                I watched to understand more about how Node.JS works. I also thank the following sources I used, such as
                W3Schools and Bootstrap.</p>

            <!-- Introduction -->
            <div id="introduction" class="full-width section-title">Introduction / Project Overview / Objectives</div>
            <p>This project, entitled "Joackim Agno Portfolio," is a web development project aimed at showcasing a
                professional portfolio by demonstrating the ability to develop a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                Bootstrap, Node, and React. This website features various sections, such as a personal profile, photo
                album, technical articles, and professional information and services. Each section is designed to
                highlight different aspects of my skills, achievements, and capabilities, providing a view of my
                personal and professional journey as a Computer Engineer. This project integrates advanced web
                technologies to create a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly personal website. Moreover, the website
                implements password-secured pages and server-side implementations. The primary objective of this project
                is to create a platform that effectively showcases my personal and professional achievements. Its key
                functionalities include secure access using Node.js and AJAX for handling server-side operations and
                asynchronous data exchanges, such as file uploads and content loading. Additionally, the technical
                articles section utilizes data visualization techniques with Google Charts to present data clearly. The
                professional services section includes an interactive form that processes job orders and provides
                quotations based on user inputs. Overall, the project ensures consistent design and high usability
                across all sections using Bootstrap for a unified theme.</p>

                                <p>Consider this as an "about me" page. Sensitive personal details can be omitted.</p>
                                <li>Password-secured pages</li>
                                <p>At least two webpages that have restricted access only to those who are given access
                                    accounts.</p>
                                <p>The accounts must be implemented with the use of AJAX and a text file formatted using
                                    JSON where data about accounts are stored. A password form must be implemented, and
                                    if the credentials are incorrect or information is not found in the JSON file,
                                    access is not given (i.e., the protected page(s) are not displayed).</p>

                                <li>Photo Album</li>
                                <p>This is a photo gallery implementation using jQuery, plugins, JavaScript libraries,
                                    and/or web frameworks/APIs. The photos can be any arbitrary collection with at least
                                    10 items. There should be an option for a slideshow, which will enable when a user
                                    clicks on something.</p>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For the personal page, it is a section with id="about" in my "index.html". It is
                                    accessible through the sidebar. When clicking the about me page, it will scroll to
                                    the page. It was first set up in a div class="container" with two elements, personal
                                    information and education, divided into six large columns with "col-lg-6". For the
                                    personal information, it is set up with "row-gy-4" with two elements covering the
                                    whole spread of the column "col-12". For the education, it has the same setup as the
                                    personal information column, and each element covers the whole 12 columns of
                                    Bootstrap.</li>
                                <li>
                                    My password-secured pages are the resume and the photo album. The resume is a
                                    project I did during the LBYCPG3 class, which is HTML and CSS only, and the photo
                                    album is one of the requirements in this project. Both are accessible through their
                                    respective buttons. Each button will direct to the "login.html", which opens a new
                                    webpage that contains a form. This form asks for the email and password of the user.
                                    The valid users who can access the photo album and resume are listed in the
                                    "accounts.json" file, which shows the accepted email and password. In the login
                                    page, there are two buttons for accessing either the resume or the photo album. Each
                                    button has its JavaScript in "script.js" to verify if the entered details are
                                    correct.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    My photo album consists of 10 images. I utilized an image carousel provided by
                                    Bootstrap and added elements by calling each div with the same class
                                    "carousel-item". For the JavaScript of the carousel, it initializes without a
                                    slideshow first. The slideshow only activates through a button click. Again, my
                                    photo album is a password-secured page, so it's only accessible through the
                                    login.html.
                                </li>

                                <p>This is a collection of technical articles or tutorials. Article 1 should include an
                                    embedded video player to play some related video. Articles 2 and 3 should
                                    collectively incorporate bar, pie, and line charts using Google Charts.</p>
                                <li>Professional Services</li>
                                <p>This is one or more pages that offer certain CPE-related professional services. One
                                    of the pages should include a form that specifies a job order/engagement form that
                                    will be processed by JavaScript code upon submission and returns a summary page with
                                    a quotation based on the form entries.</p>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <ul>
                                <li>My portfolio page is in the section of index.html with id="accomplishments". This
                                    shows all my past projects in my past courses. The section is divided into two
                                    columns by "col-lg-6" so that each element or project I add is divided into two.
                                    Next, each project I did is placed in a div class="card" with its respective photo,
                                    title, and description.</li>
                                <li>
                                    My technical articles section is in the index.html with section id="articles". This
                                    section is divided into three columns through "col-md-4". For the first article, it
                                    consists of an embedded video. This embedded video is in an "iframe", and in order
                                    for the YouTube link to work, I changed its URL to "youtube.com/embed/[link]". Next,
                                    to do articles 2 and 3, I used a Google JavaScript library, specifically the Google
                                    Charts library. For the data of both articles, it is specified in my data.json file.
                                    Then, my main website will call the JavaScript function to load the data from JSON
                                    using the library.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    My services are in a section with id="services" in index.html. Each element is
                                    divided into three columns through "col-md-4". I provided a title and a short
                                    description. Each element has a href link going to my /file_upload_node/index.html.
                                    This webpage is where all the forms are for inquiring about my services. In this
                                    webpage, I have three services offered, and each has a respective form. The user has
                                    to enter necessary details, and when they hover on the text boxes, tooltips appear.
                                    When they submit the form, they will be redirected to another webpage that shows
                                    their quotation and a file submission button. This file submission button is for
                                    them to upload a PDF or DOCX file for additional information regarding the service
                                    they require. This button runs through the Node.JS server.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Other Requirements</td>
                        <td>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Node.JS</li>
                                <li>React.JS</li>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <ul>
                                <li>First, I installed Node.js, then I opened my terminal with the path in the folder
                                    where I wanted to store my Node files. Next, the command "npm init -y" is used to
                                    initialize my package.json. This is a quick setup to have a package.json without
                                    manually typing it. Next, I installed express-fileupload and nodemon.
                                    Express-fileupload is for handling file uploads, and nodemon is for the constant
                                    refresh of my server. In my package.json, my main file is "app.js", and I also
                                    changed the "scripts" part: the "start" script to "node app.js" and the "dev" script
                                    to "nodemon app.js". Next, I created the app.js file with express and cors as
                                    required and set the port to 3500. Generally, for the file upload, its HTML file is
                                    in the file_upload_node folder. It handles the submission button for the file
                                    upload. I also added middleware for my file upload, which includes a file extension
                                    limiter, file size limiter, and file existence checker. If the file meets all the
                                    requirements of the middleware, I will fetch the Node server and get the file. For
                                    the HTML loader using Node.JS, it is in the same folder as the file upload. The only
                                    difference is how they are fetched. File uploads are fetched on port/upload, while
                                    the HTML is fetched on port/content.</li>
                                <li>For the React.JS, I created the app and generated the package.json with the command
                                    "npx create-react-app article5". Then, in the directory article5, I inputted the
                                    command "npm start" which initializes the server as running. I added a components
                                    folder in my src folder. The components folder have my JS elements to be called by
                                    my App.js. I have two components which are ArticleFooter.js and ArticleSection.js.

                    <tr>
                        <td>Website Technical Requirements</td>
                        <td>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The website's look/theme should generally be set by Bootstrap.</li>
                                <li>Any functionality requiring JavaScript may use native JavaScript or jQuery unless
                                    explicitly stated in an item in this set of project guidelines.</li>
                                <li>No standard database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) must be used.</li>
                                <li>Unless otherwise specified, PHP or any other programming languages besides
                                    JavaScript or related libraries cannot be used.</li>
                                <li>Each web page must have the same look/theme and should include a header, footer,
                                    navigation, and main content sections at the minimum.</li>
                                <li>There should be at least one drop-down menu.</li>
                                <li>One or more webpages should incorporate tooltips.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <ul>
                                <li>First, for the Bootstrap requirements, I downloaded bootstrap.min.css and
                                    bootstrap.bundle.min.js for the general setup of my website. Next, I downloaded
                                    fonts I wanted to use on my website and added them to my assets folder. I also added
                                    a JavaScript library called AOS (Animate On Scroll) for the animations of the
                                    elements on my website. The files I added are aos.js and aos.css. Next, I added
                                    another library, line-awesome.css, which I used for my href links on the website.
                                    All of these are called in my website to use all libraries and Bootstrap.</li>
                                <li>
                                    I have an assets folder that holds all the images, scripts, fonts, and CSS files. To
                                    apply the general theme to all my webpages, I declared all CSS in my styles.css
                                    file. Then, for the general JavaScript functions, they are all declared in the
                                    main.js file.
                                </li>
                                <li>The dropdown in this project is the sidebar. When the device width is too small, it
                                    will become a dropdown menu. I have a navbar to navigate through index.html.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
