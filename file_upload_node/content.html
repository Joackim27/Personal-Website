        <h5>Quantum Computing</h5>
        <p>
            Quantum computing is an exciting new field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process
            information in fundamentally different ways from classical computers. By using quantum bits (qubits),
            quantum computers can perform complex calculations at unprecedented speeds, making them ideal for tasks like
            cryptography, optimization problems, and simulations of quantum systems.
        </p>
        <h5>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h5>
        <p>
            AI is transforming the landscape of computer engineering. With advancements in machine learning, natural
            language processing, and computer vision, AI systems are now capable of performing tasks that were once
            considered impossible for machines. Applications of AI range from autonomous vehicles and smart assistants
            to advanced data analytics and predictive maintenance.
        </p>
        <h5>Edge Computing</h5>
        <p>
            Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve
            response times and save bandwidth. This technology is particularly useful for the Internet of Things (IoT)
            devices, autonomous systems, and real-time applications, where latency and bandwidth are critical concerns.
